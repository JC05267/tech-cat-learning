## AWS
- EC2 is just a virtual machine
- SaaS = e.g. gmail, salesforce. Everything is taken care of for you. 
- PaaS = e.g. Lambda, don't need to worry about the machine
- IaaS = a VM you are responsible for e.g. EC2

- AWS Shared Responsibility Model is important
    - AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud 
    - You are responsible for security IN the cloud

## Provisioning AWS Resources
- via web console
- via CLI
- via SDK
- Other tools like AWS CloudFormation

## CloudFormation
- lets you provision by AWS via template file (json or yaml)
Example simple template to create a bucket. 
```yaml
Resources:
    HelloBucket:
        Type: `AWS::S3::Bucket`
```
- Creates it for you in proper order
- This is infrastructure as code
- cost: resources within the stack are tagged w/ identifier so you can see how much stuff costs
- you can spin up and delete easily for money savings

## SQL Databases
- Athena is technically not a database. It's a query engine on top of S3
- see `db-engines.com`
- relational databases are the most popular
- RDBMS - software layer of tools
- multiple users can work with same database in different ways
- TABLES
- CRUD Operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Joins: Inner, left, right, cross, full outer
## NOSQL Databases
- flexible data models
- horizontal scaling
- simple design
- high acailability
- support of SQL-like languages

## Scaling
- Vertical Scaling: Increase in processing power
- Horizontal Scaling: Increase number of machines

## Amazaon Aurora
- MySQL, PostreSQL compatible relational database engine
- distributed, fault tolerant, auto-scales
- 5x faster then MySQL, 3x faster then postgres
- high performance

## Amazon DynamoDB
- key-value, document
- MULTI-region built in security, backup/restore etc

## Amazon ElastiCache
- in memory caches
- stores data across multiple places

## Amazon RDS
- supports lots of relational databases
- lets you easily manage lots of relational databases

## AWS Timesteam
- fast, scalable, mangaed time series database service
- built for time stream data

## AWS Neptune
- graph database

## AWS Glue
- glue is baed on spark engine
- ETL tool, but can also do other things
- Glue Crawler
    - 
- ETL - automatic code generation
- encryption
    - Server-side(at rest)
    - SSL(in transit)
- can be event-driven
- Can scale DPUs(data processing unit)
- transform, clean, enrich data
- serverless Spark platform
- Glue Scheduler to schedule jobs
- Glue triggers to automate job runs based on events
- fully managed, cost effective
- Lots of bundled transformation
- Some ML transformations
    - FindMatches - can identify matching records
- format conversions, CSV, JSON etc
- Apache Spark transformations
    - convert between spark dataframe and glue dynamic frame
- Glue Studio
    - drag and drop for Glue
- Glue Workflows
    - multi-job, multi-crawler ETL processes run together
    - create from Glue blueprint from console or api
    - for orchestrating complex ETL operations
