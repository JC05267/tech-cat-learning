## Python lists
Lists are not immutable
```python

```

## Python Dictionaries
```python
empty = dict()
person = {
    "name":"foo",
    "age": 15,
    "city": "bar",
    "a bool": True
}

person.keys()
person.values()

for key in person.keys():
    print(key)
for value in person.value():
    print(value)
for k, v in person.items():
    print(k, v)

person['hobbies'] = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
```
## Python Sets
```python
set([1,2,3,4,5,5,5,6,7,8,9,9])
```

## Python Tuples
Tuples are immutable.
```python
t = (1,3,4,"five", "foo")
```

## Read files
```python
# read
with open("file-name.ext", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

# append
with open("file-name-new.ext", "w") as file:
    content = file.read()

# append
with open("file-name.ext", "a") as file:
    content = file.read()

# csv data
with open("data.csv", "r") as file:
    content = csv.reader(file)
    for row in content:
        print(row)

# json data
import json
data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

with open("file.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(data, file)
```

## User input
```python
input("What is your name")
```
