## Database
- structured collection of data organized and stored
- organization, integrity, security, concurrency, recovery are all important for databases

- A datawarehouse(dw) is a type of database that is specifically designed for analytics.
    - stores structured and filtered data
    - query and reporting

- Snowflake is a cloud-based data platform
    - storage and compute
    -

## OLTP vs Datawarehouse(DW)/OLAP
- OLTP = Online transactional processing
- OLAP = Online analytics processing

### OLTP
- designed for *transactions*
- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- usually highly normalized
- data integrity (ACID)
- think ROWS
- real time
- complex joins b/c of normalization
- harder to scale horizontally

### Datawarehouse/OLAP
- designed for *analytics*
- aggregations, 
- can be denormalized to avoid complex joins, etc
- think COLUMNS
- higher costs, more complex to maintain
- latency between data generation and data in warehouse
